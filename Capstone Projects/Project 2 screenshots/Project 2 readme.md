Deploying an Apache web server using Terraform involves defining the necessary infrastructure as code, 
which includes creating and configuring resources such as virtual machines, security groups, and network configurations.
Here are the steps that I used to deploy an Apache web server using Terraform in the screenshots.

***Please note*****
You'd notice I changed locations in some of the screenshots, because I had issues with my AWS account. 
Hence, I had to change locations in my provider to get results.However, the codes used in deploying 
the resources in terraform are the same.

Thank you.
