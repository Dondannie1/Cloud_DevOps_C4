Description

3 Placement groups were created for this LAB
-Cluster, Spread and Partion.
After creating the placement groups, 2 instances were created for the spread and partioned groups
and they were attached to the instances. However, I could not attach the cluster placement group that was created because 
it didn't support the instance type that was used for this LAB (T2 micro free tier) because of it's burstable performance. 
Although, if I had changed the instance type to for example c5a.2xlarge it would have worked.
